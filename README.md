# Sysadmin

This repository contains a collection of tools and scripts I've used to automate various system administration tasks. Whether you're managing a small home network or a large corporate infrastructure, these tools can help you save time and reduce human error.

The scripts in this repository cover a wide range of tasks, including setting up and configuring network interfaces, automating software updates, monitoring system performance, and more. Many of the scripts are designed to work on Linux systems, but some may also work on other Unix-like systems.

These tools are intended to be easy to use and modify, so you can adapt them to your specific needs. Whether you're an experienced sysadmin or just getting started, you should find something useful in this repository.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or pull request. And if you find these tools helpful, don't forget to star the repository!
